  <h3>Grade 11 - 1st Semester</h3>
  <h3>Unit 1: Functions and Their Graphs</h3>
  <hr />
  <h2>Lesson 1: Definitions and Types of Functions</h2>
  <h4>Learning Objectives:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Define a function and distinguish it from general relations.</li>
    <li>Identify different types of mathematical functions.</li>
    <li>Use function notation correctly and represent functions in multiple forms.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>What is a Function?</h4>
  <p>
    A <strong>function</strong> is a special relationship where each input (x-value) has exactly one output (y-value). It maps elements from a domain to a range in such a way that no input is assigned to more than one output.
  </p>
  <h4>Example of a Function:</h4>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="8">
    <tr>
      <th>Input (x)</th>
      <th>Output (f(x))</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>6</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Each input has one output → ✔️ This is a function.</p>
  <h4>Not a Function:</h4>
  <p>If a single input corresponds to multiple outputs, it is <strong>not</strong> a function.</p>
  <pre>
Input: 1 → 2  
       1 → 3  
→ ❌ Not a function
  </pre>
  <h4>Function Notation:</h4>
  <p>
    A function is usually written as <code>f(x)</code>, which means "function of x."  
    Example: <code>f(x) = 2x + 1</code> means for every value of x, multiply by 2 and add 1.
  </p>
  <h4>Ways to Represent Functions:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Set of ordered pairs: <code>{(1,2), (2,4), (3,6)}</code></li>
    <li>Table of values</li>
    <li>Mapping diagram</li>
    <li>Graph on a coordinate plane</li>
    <li>Algebraic equation</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Vertical Line Test:</h4>
  <p>
    A graph represents a function if no vertical line intersects it at more than one point.  
    This is called the <strong>vertical line test</strong>.
  </p>
  <h4>Types of Functions:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Linear Function:</strong> Graph is a straight line (e.g., <code>f(x) = 3x + 2</code>)</li>
    <li><strong>Quadratic Function:</strong> Graph is a parabola (e.g., <code>f(x) = x² - 1</code>)</li>
    <li><strong>Absolute Value Function:</strong> Graph is a V-shape (e.g., <code>f(x) = |x|</code>)</li>
    <li><strong>Piecewise Function:</strong> Defined by different expressions depending on input value</li>
    <li><strong>Constant Function:</strong> Always returns the same value (e.g., <code>f(x) = 5</code>)</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Examples in Daily Life:</h4>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="8">
    <tr>
      <th>Situation</th>
      <th>Function?</th>
      <th>Explanation</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Each student has one ID number</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>1 student = 1 ID → Function</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1 ID number belongs to multiple students</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>1 input → many outputs → Not a function</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Price of an item based on weight</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Each weight has a set price</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <h4>Key Reminders:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>All functions are relations, but not all relations are functions.</li>
    <li>Check each input for multiple outputs — that breaks a function.</li>
    <li>Functions can be visual, verbal, algebraic, or tabular.</li>
    <li>Use function notation to simplify mathematical writing.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Summary:</h4>
  <p>
    A function is a mathematical rule that assigns a single output to each input. Understanding the types, representations, and behavior of functions is the foundation for studying algebra and higher-level math concepts.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="topic">
  <h2>Lesson 2: Domain and Range</h2>
  <h4>Learning Objectives:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Define and determine the domain and range of a function.</li>
    <li>Identify restrictions in the domain based on the function's rule.</li>
    <li>Represent domain and range in set, inequality, and interval notation.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>What is Domain?</h4>
  <p>
    The <strong>domain</strong> of a function is the set of all possible input values (x-values) for which the function is defined. These are the values you can plug into the function without breaking any mathematical rule (like dividing by zero or taking the square root of a negative number).
  </p>
  <h4>What is Range?</h4>
  <p>
    The <strong>range</strong> is the set of all possible output values (y-values) that result from using the values in the domain. It represents what the function produces.
  </p>
  <h4>Example 1:</h4>
  <p><code>f(x) = x + 3</code></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Domain: All real numbers (ℝ) — you can plug in any number.</li>
    <li>Range: All real numbers (ℝ) — the output can be any number too.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Example 2:</h4>
  <p><code>f(x) = 1 / (x - 2)</code></p>
  <ul>
    <li>You cannot divide by 0, so x cannot be 2.</li>
    <li><strong>Domain:</strong> All real numbers except 2 → <code>x ≠ 2</code></li>
    <li><strong>Range:</strong> All real numbers except 0 (the output will never be 0)</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Example 3:</h4>
  <p><code>f(x) = √(x - 1)</code></p>
  <ul>
    <li>You cannot take the square root of a negative number (in real numbers).</li>
    <li><strong>Domain:</strong> x ≥ 1</li>
    <li><strong>Range:</strong> y ≥ 0</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Ways to Express Domain and Range:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Set Notation:</strong> D = {x | x ≠ 2}</li>
    <li><strong>Inequality:</strong> x > 0, x ≤ 5, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Interval Notation:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><code>(−∞, ∞)</code> → all real numbers</li>
        <li><code>[1, ∞)</code> → from 1 to infinity, including 1</li>
        <li><code>(−∞, 0)</code> → less than 0, excluding 0</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Visual Example (Table):</h4>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="8">
    <tr>
      <th>Function</th>
      <th>Domain</th>
      <th>Range</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>f(x) = x²</code></td>
      <td>All real numbers</td>
      <td>y ≥ 0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>f(x) = 1/x</code></td>
      <td>x ≠ 0</td>
      <td>y ≠ 0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>f(x) = √x</code></td>
      <td>x ≥ 0</td>
      <td>y ≥ 0</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <h4>Real-Life Applications:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fuel Consumption:</strong> The domain could be distance (can’t be negative), and the range could be fuel used.</li>
    <li><strong>Bank Account:</strong> You can’t withdraw more than your balance → range is limited by your account.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Key Reminders:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Check for restrictions like square roots and denominators when finding domain.</li>
    <li>Use graphs to help visualize the range.</li>
    <li>Always answer using the appropriate notation: set, interval, or inequality.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Summary:</h4>
  <p>
    The domain and range of a function define the limits of its input and output. They are essential in understanding where a function is valid and what it can produce. Being able to identify and express these helps in interpreting real-world situations mathematically.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="topic">
  <h2>Lesson 3: Evaluating Functions</h2>
  <h4>Learning Objectives:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Substitute input values into function expressions.</li>
    <li>Correctly evaluate the value of a function for a given input.</li>
    <li>Apply function evaluation in real-life word problems.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>What Does it Mean to Evaluate a Function?</h4>
  <p>
    To <strong>evaluate a function</strong> means to substitute a specific value for the variable (usually x) in the function and then simplify the expression to find the output (f(x)).
  </p>
  <h4>Function Notation Review:</h4>
  <p>
    Function notation is written as <code>f(x)</code>, which means "the function of x".  
    Example: <code>f(x) = 3x + 2</code>  
    This means: take any value of x, multiply it by 3, and then add 2.
  </p>
  <h4>Example 1:</h4>
  <p>Given: <code>f(x) = 2x + 5</code></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Find <code>f(3)</code></li>
    <li>Solution: <code>f(3) = 2(3) + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11</code></li>
    <li>Answer: <code>f(3) = 11</code></li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Example 2:</h4>
  <p>Given: <code>g(x) = x² - 4x + 1</code></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Find <code>g(2)</code></li>
    <li>Solution: <code>g(2) = (2)² - 4(2) + 1 = 4 - 8 + 1 = -3</code></li>
    <li>Answer: <code>g(2) = -3</code></li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Example 3:</h4>
  <p>Given: <code>h(x) = √(x + 1)</code></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Find <code>h(8)</code></li>
    <li>Solution: <code>h(8) = √(8 + 1) = √9 = 3</code></li>
    <li>Answer: <code>h(8) = 3</code></li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Real-Life Problem Example:</h4>
  <p>A delivery fee function is defined as <code>d(x) = 45 + 8x</code>, where x is the number of kilometers traveled.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How much will it cost to deliver over 5 kilometers?</li>
    <li>Solution: <code>d(5) = 45 + 8(5) = 45 + 40 = 85</code></li>
    <li>Answer: The delivery cost is ₱85</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Practice Table:</h4>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="8">
    <tr>
      <th>Function</th>
      <th>Input (x)</th>
      <th>f(x)</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>f(x) = x²</code></td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>16</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>g(x) = 2x - 1</code></td>
      <td>10</td>
      <td>19</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>h(x) = x/3</code></td>
      <td>9</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <h4>Common Mistakes to Avoid:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Forgetting to use parentheses when substituting negative values</li>
    <li>Not applying exponents before multiplication</li>
    <li>Confusing the function name with multiplication (e.g., <code>f(x)</code> is not "f times x")</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Key Reminders:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Always replace x with the given number and follow PEMDAS rules.</li>
    <li>Use a calculator for complex values or decimal results.</li>
    <li>Make sure the value is within the domain of the function before evaluating.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Summary:</h4>
  <p>
    Evaluating a function means plugging in values and simplifying to find the result. This helps in real-world applications like cost, time, population, and profit computations. Mastery of this skill is essential in using functions effectively.

<div class="topic">
  <h2>Lesson 4: Piecewise Functions</h2>
  <h4>Learning Objectives:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Understand the concept and definition of piecewise functions.</li>
    <li>Interpret and evaluate piecewise-defined functions.</li>
    <li>Graph piecewise functions based on their rules and domains.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>What is a Piecewise Function?</h4>
  <p>
    A <strong>piecewise function</strong> is a function that is defined by different expressions or rules for different parts of its domain. Each "piece" of the function applies only to specific values of the input.
  </p>
  <h4>Real-Life Analogy:</h4>
  <p>
    Think of delivery fees where different pricing rules apply depending on distance. For example:  
    - For 0–5 km: ₱50  
    - For 6–10 km: ₱70  
    - For 11+ km: ₱100  
    Each range has its own rule — that’s how a piecewise function works.
  </p>
  <h4>Example of a Piecewise Function:</h4>
  <pre>
f(x) = {
  x + 2   if x &lt; 0  
  x²      if 0 ≤ x ≤ 3  
  5       if x &gt; 3
}
  </pre>
  <h4>How to Evaluate Piecewise Functions:</h4>
  <p>
    Step 1: Look at the value of x.  
    Step 2: Determine which piece of the function applies to that x-value.  
    Step 3: Plug the value into the correct equation.
  </p>
  <h4>Example:</h4>
  <pre>
Given:
f(x) = {
  x + 2   if x &lt; 0  
  x²      if 0 ≤ x ≤ 3  
  5       if x &gt; 3
}
Find f(-2), f(2), f(4)
→ f(-2): Use x + 2 → f(-2) = -2 + 2 = 0  
→ f(2): Use x² → f(2) = 2² = 4  
→ f(4): Use 5 → f(4) = 5
  </pre>
  <h4>Graphing a Piecewise Function:</h4>
  <p>
    - Graph each equation separately over its given interval.<br>
    - Use <strong>open circle</strong> (○) if the endpoint is not included.<br>
    - Use <strong>closed circle</strong> (●) if the endpoint is included.
  </p>
  <h4>Visual Example (Table):</h4>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="8">
    <tr>
      <th>x</th>
      <th>f(x)</th>

  <h2>Lesson 5: Graphs of Functions</h2>
  <h4>Learning Objectives:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify the graphical representation of common functions.</li>
    <li>Plot and analyze the shape and characteristics of different types of functions.</li>
    <li>Interpret key features of a function's graph such as intercepts, domain, range, and symmetry.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>What is a Graph of a Function?</h4>
  <p>
    A function’s graph is a visual representation of all the ordered pairs (x, f(x)) that satisfy the function. It allows us to see the behavior of a function — how it increases or decreases, where it intercepts the axes, and whether it is linear, quadratic, or otherwise.
  </p>
  <h4>Common Function Graphs:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Linear Function:</strong> <code>f(x) = mx + b</code>  
      - Graph: A straight line  
      - m = slope, b = y-intercept  
      - Domain and range: All real numbers</li>
    <li><strong>Quadratic Function:</strong> <code>f(x) = ax² + bx + c</code>  
      - Graph: A parabola  
      - Opens upward if a > 0, downward if a < 0  
      - Vertex is the highest or lowest point</li>
    <li><strong>Absolute Value Function:</strong> <code>f(x) = |x|</code>  
      - Graph: A "V" shape  
      - Vertex at origin (0,0)  
      - Symmetric about the y-axis</li>
    <li><strong>Constant Function:</strong> <code>f(x) = c</code>  
      - Graph: A horizontal line  
      - y-value is constant regardless of x</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Key Features of Graphs:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>X-intercept:</strong> Point where the graph crosses the x-axis (f(x) = 0)</li>
    <li><strong>Y-intercept:</strong> Point where the graph crosses the y-axis (x = 0)</li>
    <li><strong>Symmetry:</strong> Is the graph mirrored about the y-axis or origin?</li>
    <li><strong>End behavior:</strong> What happens to f(x) as x → ±∞?</li>
    <li><strong>Intervals:</strong> Where is the function increasing or decreasing?</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Example: Graph of f(x) = 2x + 1</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>This is a linear function.</li>
    <li>Slope (m) = 2, Y-intercept (b) = 1</li>
    <li>Graph passes through (0,1) and rises 2 units for every 1 unit increase in x</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Example: Graph of f(x) = x² - 4</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>This is a quadratic function (parabola).</li>
    <li>Vertex: (0, -4)</li>
    <li>Opens upward</li>
    <li>X-intercepts: Solve x² - 4 = 0 → x = ±2</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Graphing Tips:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Make a table of values for x and calculate f(x)</li>
    <li>Plot at least 5 points to get an accurate shape</li>
    <li>Check symmetry (especially for parabolas or absolute values)</li>
    <li>Label axes and intercepts clearly</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Graph Interpretation Practice Table:</h4>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="8">
    <tr>
      <th>Function</th>
      <th>Type</th>

    <tr>
      <td><code>f(x) = 5</code></td>
      <td>Constant</td>
      <td>Horizontal Line</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <h4>Common Mistakes to Avoid:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Forgetting to use enough points when plotting</li>
    <li>Incorrect placement of intercepts or vertex</li>
    <li>Confusing shape of different functions (e.g., linear vs. quadratic)</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Summary:</h4>
  <p>
    Graphs provide a powerful way to visualize functions and understand their behavior. Knowing how to identify, plot, and analyze function graphs helps in problem-solving, data interpretation, and modeling real-life scenarios.

<div class="topic">
  <h2>Lesson 6: Transformations of Functions</h2>
  <h4>Learning Objectives:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify and describe different types of transformations on function graphs.</li>
    <li>Apply transformations such as translations, reflections, and scaling to function equations.</li>
    <li>Sketch graphs of transformed functions.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>What are Transformations of Functions?</h4>
  <p>
    Transformations are changes made to the graph of a function. These changes can move the graph up, down, left, or right; flip it over an axis; or stretch/compress it.
  </p>
  <h4>Types of Transformations:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Translation:</strong> Shifting the graph without changing its shape.</li>
    <li><strong>Reflection:</strong> Flipping the graph across an axis.</li>
    <li><strong>Stretch/Compression (Scaling):</strong> Making the graph taller, shorter, wider, or narrower.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>1. Translations</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Vertical Shift:</strong> <code>f(x) + c</code> moves the graph up if c > 0, down if c < 0</li>
    <li><strong>Horizontal Shift:</strong> <code>f(x − c)</code> moves the graph right if c > 0, left if c < 0</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Example:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><code>f(x) = x²</code> → original parabola</li>
    <li><code>f(x) = x² + 3</code> → moves up 3 units</li>
    <li><code>f(x) = (x − 2)²</code> → moves right 2 units</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>2. Reflections</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Over x-axis:</strong> <code>−f(x)</code> → flips the graph upside down</li>
    <li><strong>Over y-axis:</strong> <code>f(−x)</code> → mirrors the graph left to right</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Example:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><code>f(x) = x³</code></li>
    <li><code>−f(x) = −x³</code> → reflected over x-axis</li>
    <li><code>f(−x) = (−x)³ = −x³</code> → also reflects over y-axis</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>3. Vertical & Horizontal Stretch/Compression</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Vertical Stretch:</strong> <code>a · f(x)</code> where a > 1 → graph becomes taller</li>
    <li><strong>Vertical Compression:</strong> <code>a · f(x)</code> where 0 < a < 1 → graph becomes shorter</li>
    <li><strong>Horizontal Stretch/Compression:</strong> <code>f(bx)</code> where b > 1 compresses, 0 < b < 1 stretches</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Example:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><code>f(x) = x²</code></li>
    <li><code>2f(x) = 2x²</code> → vertical stretch (taller parabola)</li>
    <li><code>0.5f(x) = 0.5x²</code> → vertical compression (wider parabola)</li>
    <li><code>f(2x) = (2x)² = 4x²</code> → horizontal compression</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Combined Transformations:</h4>
  <p>
    Multiple transformations can be combined in one function.<br>
    Example: <code>y = −2(x − 3)² + 1</code>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Shift right 3 units</li>
    <li>Reflect over x-axis</li>
    <li>Vertical stretch by 2</li>
    <li>Shift up 1 unit</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Quick Transformation Table:</h4>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="8">
    <tr>
      <th>Equation</th>
      <th>Transformation</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>f(x) + 4</code></td>
      <td>Up 4 units</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>f(x − 3)</code></td>
      <td>Right 3 units</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>−f(x)</code></td>
      <td>Reflect over x-axis</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>f(−x)</code></td>
      <td>Reflect over y-axis</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>2f(x)</code></td>
      <td>Vertical stretch</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>f(0.5x)</code></td>
      <td>Horizontal stretch</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <h4>Key Reminders:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Do transformations step-by-step if more than one is applied.</li>
    <li>Use tables and graphs to double-check changes.</li>
    <li>Follow correct order: inside changes (horizontal) → outside changes (vertical).</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Summary:</h4>
  <p>
    Transformations change the position and shape of a function's graph. Understanding how each transformation affects the function allows for more flexible graphing and function manipulation.

    Web design is the process of creating the layout, visual appearance, and usability of a website. It includes the use of <strong>HTML</strong> (Hypertext Markup Language) for structure and <strong>CSS</strong> (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling.
  </p>
  <h4>What is HTML?</h4>
  <p>
    <strong>HTML</strong> is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It defines the structure of content by using tags.
  </p>
  <h5>Basic HTML Structure:</h5>
  <pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My First Website&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Page&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
  </pre>
  <h5>Common HTML Tags:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li><code>&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;</code> – Headings</li>
    <li><code>&lt;p&gt;</code> – Paragraph</li>
    <li><code>&lt;a href=""&gt;</code> – Hyperlink</li>
    <li><code>&lt;img src=""&gt;</code> – Image</li>
    <li><code>&lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, &lt;li&gt;</code> – Lists</li>
    <li><code>&lt;div&gt;</code> – Division/container</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>What is CSS?</h4>
  <p>
    <strong>CSS</strong> is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of HTML elements — such as colors, layouts, and fonts. CSS separates content from design.
  </p>
  <h5>Basic CSS Syntax:</h5>
  <pre>
selector {
  property: value;
}
  </pre>

  <h5>Example:</h5>
  <pre>
p {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 16px;
}
  </pre>
  <h4>Ways to Apply CSS:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Inline:</strong> inside HTML element (not recommended for full sites)</li>
    <li><strong>Internal:</strong> within &lt;style&gt; tag in the &lt;head&gt;</li>
    <li><strong>External:</strong> separate .css file (recommended)</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Basic Layout Concepts:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Box Model:</strong> Content → Padding → Border → Margin</li>
    <li><strong>Flexbox/Grid:</strong> Used for flexible layouts and responsive design</li>
    <li><strong>Media Queries:</strong> CSS rules based on screen size for responsive design</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Example: Simple Web Page</h4>
  <pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;style&gt;
    body {
      background-color: #f0f0f0;
      font-family: Arial;
    }
    h1 {
      color: navy;
    }
  &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;My First Website&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is an example of HTML with CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
  </pre>
  <h4>Design Tips:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep your layout clean and simple.</li>
    <li>Use a readable font and consistent color scheme.</li>
    <li>Organize your content using sections and containers.</li>
    <li>Test your website on different screen sizes.</li>
    <li>Write semantic HTML for accessibility and SEO.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Tools for Web Design:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Text Editors: VS Code, Sublime Text, Notepad++</li>
    <li>Design: Figma, Canva, Adobe XD</li>
    <li>Testing: Browser Developer Tools, Lighthouse, Responsively App</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Summary:</h4>
  <p>
    HTML and CSS are foundational skills for creating websites. HTML structures the content, while CSS makes it visually appealing. With practice, you can build responsive and engaging websites for school projects or personal portfolios.

    <h2>Lesson 2: Elements of Communication</h2>
    <h4>Learning Objectives:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify and define the elements involved in the communication process.</li>
      <li>Explain the role of each element in effective communication.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>What are the Elements of Communication?</h4>
    <p>
    Communication involves several key components that work together to ensure a message is delivered and understood. These are called the <strong>elements of communication</strong>. Each element plays a specific role in the process.
    </p>
    <h4>Elements of the Communication Process:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Sender (Source/Encoder):</strong> The person who creates and delivers the message. The sender encodes (converts thoughts into words or symbols).</li>
      <li><strong>Message:</strong> The information, idea, or emotion that is being communicated.</li>
      <li><strong>Encoding:</strong> The process of converting thoughts or feelings into verbal or non-verbal symbols.</li>
      <li><strong>Channel:</strong> The medium or method used to send the message (e.g., spoken word, written text, gesture, email).</li>
      <li><strong>Receiver (Decoder):</strong> The person who gets the message and interprets it.</li>
     <li><strong>Decoding:</strong> The process of interpreting or making sense of the message.</li>
      <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> The response given by the receiver to the sender. It tells the sender whether the message was understood.</li>
      <li><strong>Noise:</strong> Any barrier or interference that affects the clarity or accuracy of the message (e.g., distractions, language differences, emotional state).</li>
      <li><strong>Context:</strong> The situation or environment where communication takes place (e.g., classroom, workplace, online).</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Illustration of the Process:</h4>
    <p>
      <em>Sender → Encoding → Message → Channel → Receiver → Decoding → Feedback</em><br>
    (All happening within a specific <strong>Context</strong>, possibly affected by <strong>Noise</strong>)
    </p>
    <h4>Example:</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Scenario:</strong> A student giving a classroom report.  
      <br><strong>Sender:</strong> The student  
      <br><strong>Message:</strong> Report content  
      <br><strong>Encoding:</strong> Organizing ideas into speech  
      <br><strong>Channel:</strong> Verbal/oral (speech)  
      <br><strong>Receiver:</strong> Classmates and teacher  
      <br><strong>Decoding:</strong> Listeners interpret the report  
      <br><strong>Feedback:</strong> Nods, questions, comments  
      <br><strong>Noise:</strong> Classmates talking, unclear voice  
      <br><strong>Context:</strong> Inside the classroom  
    </p>
    <h4>Importance of Each Element:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>All elements must work together for communication to succeed.</li>
      <li>A failure or weakness in one element (e.g., unclear message or distracted listener) may cause a communication breakdown.</li>
      <li>Being aware of these elements helps improve your communication skills in both academic and real-world settings.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Summary:</h4>
    <p>
    The communication process involves a sender, message, channel, receiver, feedback, and is influenced by noise and context. Understanding each element allows us to express ourselves clearly and avoid breakdowns in communication.

  <h2>Lesson 3: Models of Communication</h2>
  <h4>Learning Objectives:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify the different models of communication.</li>
    <li>Compare the features and flow of communication in each model.</li>
    <li>Recognize the strengths and limitations of each model.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>What is a Communication Model?</h4>
  <p>
    A <strong>communication model</strong> is a visual or symbolic representation of the communication process.  
    Models help us understand how communication works by identifying its components, flow, and possible breakdowns.
  </p>
  <h4>Types of Communication Models:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Linear Model</strong> (One-Way)</li>
    <li><strong>Interactive Model</strong> (Two-Way with Feedback)</li>
    <li><strong>Transactional Model</strong> (Simultaneous Exchange)</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>1. Linear Model of Communication</h3>
  <p>
    The **Linear Model** describes communication as a one-way process. The sender transmits a message through a channel to the receiver.  
    <br><br>
    <strong>Example:</strong> A radio announcer delivering news to the public.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Key Components:</strong> Sender → Message → Channel → Receiver</p>
  <p><strong>Limitation:</strong> No feedback; the receiver is passive.</p>
  <h3>2. Interactive Model of Communication</h3>
  <p>
    The **Interactive Model** introduces feedback and context. After receiving a message, the receiver sends a response.  
    <br><br>
    <strong>Example:</strong> An online chat where users take turns replying.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Key Components:</strong> Sender → Message → Receiver → Feedback (with context)</p>
  <p><strong>Strength:</strong> Recognizes the role of feedback.</p>
  <p><strong>Limitation:</strong> Feedback is still not simultaneous; it’s turn-based.</p>
  <h3>3. Transactional Model of Communication</h3>
  <p>
    The **Transactional Model** sees communication as a continuous and simultaneous process. Both participants are sender and receiver at the same time.  
    <br><br>
    <strong>Example:</strong> A face-to-face conversation where both people give and receive cues at once (verbal and non-verbal).
  </p>
  <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Simultaneous sending and receiving of messages</li>
    <li>Includes context, noise, and feedback</li>
    <li>Considers body language, tone, facial expressions</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Strength:</strong> Most realistic model for real-world interaction</p>

      <td>Transactional</td>
      <td>Two-way (simultaneous)</td>
      <td>Yes (real-time)</td>
      <td>Face-to-face talk</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <h4>Why Models Matter:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>They simplify complex processes.</li>
    <li>Help us analyze communication in different settings.</li>
    <li>Assist in identifying where breakdowns happen.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Summary:</h4>
  <p>
    The Linear, Interactive, and Transactional Models each provide a different view of communication. Understanding all three helps us improve how we send and receive messages in academic, personal, and professional situations.

  <h2>Lesson 4: Functions of Communication</h2>
  <h4>Learning Objectives:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify the major functions of communication.</li>
    <li>Explain how communication serves personal, academic, and social purposes.</li>
    <li>Demonstrate how each function is applied in real-life situations.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>What Are the Functions of Communication?</h4>
  <p>
    Communication serves many purposes in our daily lives. These are called the <strong>functions of communication</strong>. Each function shows a reason why we communicate — whether to express ideas, influence others, build relationships, or understand ourselves.
  </p>
  <h4>Main Functions of Communication:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Regulation and Control</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Social Interaction</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Motivation</strong></li>
